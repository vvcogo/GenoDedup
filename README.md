# GenoDedup
This is the repository for GenoDedup, an efficient similarity-based deduplication and delta-encoding for sequencing data.
The source-code available in the src folder contains prototypes of the functions used in this tool. The final version of the GenoDedup is going to be refactored and commited in the next weeks.
